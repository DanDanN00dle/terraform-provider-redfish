# Contributing to Terraform - Redfish Provider
You can submit a work in progress (WIP) pull request, or file an issue with the parts you know. We'll do our best to guide you in the right direction, and let you know if there are guidelines we will need to follow. We want people to be able to participate without fear of doing the wrong thing. We are also in the same boat as you :smiley:

Below are our expectations for contributors. Following these guidelines gives us
the best opportunity to work with you, by making sure we have the things we need
in order to make it happen. Doing your best to follow it will speed up our
ability to merge PRs and respond to issues.
